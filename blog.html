        <h2>A Day Bike Riding in Singapore</h2>
        <p>This is my first blog post. Today I was in Singapore.
          I rode a rental bike around Marina Bay for fun.
          It was S$15 for around an hour and a half. Pretty good deal.
          After that, I chilled in the hotel room for a little bit.
          Finally, I went to a hackathon at night.
          The hackathon was in some random private room in a mall.
          The mall had a few cool bookstores and other stuff.
          <br>
          Overall, it was a good day. I had some fun.
